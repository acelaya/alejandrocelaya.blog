About a year ago I wrote two articles discussing the best way to work with modules with sub-namespaces in Zend Framework 2.

Here you can find [Part 1](/2014/05/21/create-modules-with-sub-namespaces-in-zend-framework-2/) and [Part 2](http://alejandrocelaya.blog/2014/06/21/create-modules-with-sub-namespaces-in-zend-framework-2-part-ii/)

The solution provided in those articles was functional, but it introduced some new problems to deal with. It happens that after some time working with sub-namespaced modules I have found the best way to solve those new problems, and I wanted to write this new article explaining it.

For this article I'm going to use the example namespace `ZasDev\AtomicReader`, which belongs to a real [application](https://github.com/zasDev/atomic-reader) I'm working on. For example, in my `Auth` module, a real fully qualified class name could be `ZasDev\AtomicReader\Auth\Controller\LoginController`.

### The problems

#### Autoloading

By default, ZF2 uses a psr-0-like way to perform autoloading. This would force us to create a new folder per namespace level in our module, but since `Module` classes "are loaded" from the root of the module and the rest of the classes are loaded from the nested src folder, it would be 2 new folders per namespace instead.

With the previously mentioned namespace, the module's folder structure would be this.
 
```
modules
└── ZasDev
    └── AtomicReader
        └── Auth
            ├── config
            │   └── ...
            ├── view
            │   └── ...
            ├── src
            │   └── ZasDev
            │       └── AtomicReader
            │           └── Auth
            │               ├── Controller
            │               │   └── LoginController.php
            │               ├── Form
            │               │   └── ...
            │               └── Service
            │                   └── ...
            └── Module.php
```

There are people that think that is the correct way to work, but I don't like to have so many "empty" folders.

#### View scripts resolution

As I mentioned in previous articles, the automatic view script resolution in Zend Framework 2 when a controller's action returns a `ViewModel` instance is to use the action's name as the script name, the controllers' class name as the parent folder, and the first level namespace as the root folder. That is a problem when all the modules have a common top-level namespace.
 
In the original articles we found that the solution was to use the `controller_map` option for the `view_manager` configuration like this.

```php
<?php
return [
    'view_manager' => [
        'controller_map' => [
            'ZasDev' => true
        ]
    ]
];
```

That will make the view resolver to use all the controller's namespace levels as folders, which solves the original problem but generates a similar problem as in the autoloading case, by making us to have a lot of empty folders.

The last example would produce this folder structure for view scripts.

```
modules
└── ZasDev
    └── AtomicReader
        └── Auth
            ├── config
            │   └── ...
            ├── view
            │   └── zas-dev
            │       └── atomic-reader
            │           └── auth
            │               └── login
            │                   └── index.phtml
            ├── src
            │   └── ...
            └── Module.php
```

### The solutions

It turns out that the solution to both problems is really easy.

This days everybody uses [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) on their PHP projects. Using composer's autoloading we can solve the first problem.
 
By having this module's folder structure, which is much more usable.

```
modules
└── Auth
    ├── config
    │   └── ...
    ├── view
    │   └── ...
    └── src
        ├── Controller
        │   └── LoginController.php
        ├── Form
        │   └── ...
        ├── Service
        │   └── ...
        └── Module.php
```

We just need to define this psr-4 autoloading strategy in our composer.json and all the classes will be properly loaded.

```javascript
// composer.json
{
    "autoload" : {
        "psr-4" : {
            "ZasDev\\AtomicReader\\Auth\\" : "modules/Auth/src"
        }
    }
}
```

And then just refresh the autoloader by running `composer dumpautoload`.

Repeat that for each module and that's it. Also you won't need to define the module's autoloading in the `Module` class.

The problem with the view scripts resolution can be fixed by changing the `controller_map` configuration a little bit. It turns out that it allows to map module namespaces to folder structures, so that not all the levels are replaced by folders in the path resolution.

With this configuration, we will get controllers in the `ZasDev\AtomicReader\Auth` namespace to be resolved to the `auth` folder.

```php
<?php
return [
    'view_manager' => [
        'controller_map' => [
            'ZasDev\AtomicReader\Auth' => 'auth',
            // ...
        ]
    ]
];
```

And our complete module's folder structure will end like this.

```
modules
└── Auth
    ├── config
    │   └── ...
    ├── view
    │   └── auth
    │       └── login
    │           └── index.phtml
    └── src
        ├── Controller
        │   └── LoginController.php
        ├── Form
        │   └── ...
        ├── Service
        │   └── ...
        └── Module.php
```

### Other approaches

Of course, even though I think this is the best solution, it is not the only one.
 
For the templates problem, you could use a `template_map` to get view scripts resolved, but during development that's not the best scenario, since you will be forced to update that map every time you create a new template file.

Also, you could think that the first approach with a lot of folders is the best one. Be free to use it if you are more confortable with it.

Another solution would be to "pack" all the namespaces in a unique namespace that includes the vendor name, the applicaton name and the module name, like `ZasDevAtomicReaderAuth`, with classes like `ZasDevAtomicReaderAuth\Controller\LoginController`, but I don't think that's the best solution either.

Anyway, following this rules, you will be able to use sub-namespaces in modules in a very easy way.
