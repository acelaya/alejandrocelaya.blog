I have always struggled with how packages are versioned and published to the npm registry.

My main concern is that you probably want to also add a git tag to your source code when you are releasing a new version, but npm packages have their own versioning system, and include a "version" field in the package.json

Because of this, most of the workflows I have seen, usually involve:

1. Running `npm version ...`. This will update the "version" field in the package.json file.
2. Publishing the package to the npm registry, using the version set in previous step.
3. Committing to git, so that we track the change in package.json file.
4. Adding a git tag.
5. Pushing to git remote to track new commit and new tag.

> Steps 3 and 4 are frequently done automatically as part of `npm version`.

For me this flow has two main problems:

* My personal preference is that everything is driven by git tags, making them the single source of truth.

  This would allow to just have one manual step -> `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "..." && git push origin --tags`. Then, this would trigger a number of potential automations, including publishing to the npm registry, but also others like creating a release with the appropriate release notes, building release artifacts, etc.

* The "version" field in the package.json file can very easily become outdated, if you git-tag by mistake before publishing the package, or if pushing the changes fails after `npm version ...` has been run.

  I've seen this happening more often than it seems.

Because of this, my current take when publishing npm packages for my personal projects is:

1. Get rid of the "version" field from the package.json file. It's misleading in source code, as it can very easily be out of date.

    The only case where it's useful is when the package has been installed and is inside node_modules, as other packages will assume this field to exist and have the right value on it.

    In this case it's always going to be correct due to  the`npm version ...` + `npm publish` tandem (see next point).

2. Creating the git tag is the only "manual step". This triggers an automation running `npm version ${GIT_TAG} --git-tag-version=false && npm publish` (this is simplified. You probably also need to build your project and other potential extra steps).

    The version to publish is inferred from the git tag (`${GIT_TAG}` is just a placeholder), and only at this stage we will set the "version" inside package.json, just before the package is published.

3. Other automations that need to happen during releases, can be also triggered now, like publishing release notes, building artifacts, etc.
