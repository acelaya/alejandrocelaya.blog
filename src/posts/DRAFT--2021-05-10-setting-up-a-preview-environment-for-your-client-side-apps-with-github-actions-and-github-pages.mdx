In the last couple of days I have been playing around with the idea of combining GitHub actions and GitHub pages to be able to dynamically build preview environments every time a pull request is opened against a repository hosting a client-side web app.

The idea is that you can quickly preview the changes made by some contributor, without having to clone their branch and set-up everything locally, something specially useful for open source projects.

In this article I will explain how to set everything up, and what are some of the considerations and problems you may face during the process.



Important things when using forks:
* Use pull_request_target event, and not pull_request: https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/
* Checkout code from fork
repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
* Explain IMPORTANT security considerations

Other considerations:
* May take a couple of minutes to be available
* You should consider cleaning your env
* You cannot have a backend due to the limitations of github pages
