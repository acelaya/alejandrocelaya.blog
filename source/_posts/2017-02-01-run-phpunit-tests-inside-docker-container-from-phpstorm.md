Docker is, without any doubt, the trending tool these days. Everybody wants to use it, because it is very useful, allowing to easily generate development environments for any kind of application, and also redesigning the way applications get delivered.

A couple months ago I started working with docker myself (it took me a while, I know), and now I can't imagine working without it.

I started using it at work, but all of my OSS projects have come next.

### Integration with PhpStorm

Regardless docker is very cool, there is a transition problem.

I had my development environment configured, and all my tools properly integrated. I was able, among other things, to run any project tests from within PhpStorm
